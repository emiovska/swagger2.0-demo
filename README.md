# Overview
Swagger is a simple powerful tool for documentation and representation of a RESTful APIs.  The setup process of the Swagger is relatively fast and easy. The best thing about Swagger is the ability to document APIs directly in the source code (Java) via annotations so that documentation and actual API implementations are never out of synchronization.

There are multiple benefits of using Swagger:
- **It's comprehensible for developers and non-developers** - Product managers, partners, and even the potential clients can have a look into the design the API.
- **Better understanding of the API** - The multiple annotations that Swagger offers, help developers to fast and easy understand and start using the API.
